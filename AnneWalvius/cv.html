        <h1>CV</h1>
        <img src="me.jpg" />
        
        <p> My name is Anne Walvius and I am currently a student of Book and Digital Media Studies at Leiden University. 
            <br />I'm a 24-year-old Dutch student from Delft.</p>
        
        <h3>Educational Background</h3>
        
        <p> Prior to this I studied at <a href= 'https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/'> Leiden University</a>. I have completed a bachelor's in History and Art History. 
            For both, the subject of my bachelor thesis had to do with books. Although the content of the book, in one case the text and in the other case the illuminations, was the focus of my paper, I also got to learn a lot about other aspects of the world of the book. 
            During my third year of Art History I followed a part of the minor 'Boek, boekhandel en uitgevrij', which introduced me to more current aspects of the world of the book, like publishing and digital texts.
