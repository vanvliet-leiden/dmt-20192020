        <h1>CV: Helena Sch&ouml;b</h1>
        <p>Hi! I recently moved to Leiden for a Master's in <i>Book and Digital Media Studies</i>.</p>
        
        <p>Previously, I studied English and German Literature at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>.</p>
        
        <p>As you can see from the table below, I don't have much experience with HTML, XML, or CSS - but I am excited to learn! </p>
        
   
        <table style= "width: 100%;">
            <tr>
                <td style= "width: 20%;"><b>Prior Knowledge</b></td> <td>No prior experience with HTML, XML or CSS</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Expectations</b></td> <td>By the end of this course, I expect to have a good understanding of the basics <br/>of coding, data creation and data analysis, and to have a solid foundation on <br/>which to build further progress on.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
            
        <p> As far as human languages go, I speak: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>English</li>
        <li>German</li> 
        </ul>
       <p> Here is a <b>photo</b> of me: </p>
