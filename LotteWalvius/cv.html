        <h2> Education</h2>
        <p>   
            I have completed my bachelors in Art History at <a href= "https://www.leidenuniversiteit.nl/"> Leiden University</a>. <br/>
            During this bachelor some manuscripts were discussed, but manly focussing on the illuminations.
            Before the art history bachelor, I studied 'Education and Child studies' for two years. 
            During these two years there was a focus on learning and reading behaviour and the influences this can have on cognitive abilities. <br/>
