    <p>Sir, long ere this I should have written to you concerning the dutch book 
    -  which I began translating with great energy - I was struck with the language 
    I was compelled to employ in order to render a true translation. 
    A language which would be quite unsuited to english taste. 
    In reading pats of the both in dutch &#x27; 
    in <plaats type="country">Holland</plaats> &#x27; 
    with perhaps by far somewhat accustomed to Dutch expressions 
    I saw &#x27; felt only what I liked in the book.
    To render it agreeable to the english taste it would at last become no translation.
    I took the book to a Dutch literary person who thoroughly knows enlish 
    &#x27; has resided in <plaats type="country">England</plaats>
    for some years &#x27; she thought as I. </p>
<p> <title type="novel">&#x27;&#x27;Hilda Hall&#x27;&#x27;</title> was finished last January 
        - a tale - it will appear in May. 
       If you would like to do business with the 
        <naam type="bedrijf">&#x27;&#x27;Charing Cross&#x27;&#x27;</naam> Society, 
    or become an agent for 
    <title type="novel">&#x27;&#x27;Hilda Hall&#x27;&#x27;</title> 
       please write to <naam type="persoon">Mr. Tomkins secretary</naam> 
       <plaats type="adress">5 &#x27;riar st Broadway</plaats>. 
    Either in english or in French- but Dutch is very little understood in England.
    I mentioned your firm at the office. I believe a very great number of English books
    are read in Holland &#x27; at present I do not think the 
    <naam type="bedrijf">&#x27;&#x27;Charing Cross&#x27;&#x27;</naam> office
    has an agent in <plaats type="country">Holland</plaats>.</p>
    <p>I am Sir </p>
    <p>Yours very respectfully</p>
