    <h3> Academic background</h3>
        <p>I have a bachelor degree in History from <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en"> Leiden University. </a> <br/>
        My bachelor specilisation is contemporary history with a focus on nationalism in the 20th century. <br/>
        I wrote my thesis on the employment of Dutch political offenders in New Guinea within the framework of punishment, probation and colonialism.

                    My experience related to the master Book and Digital Media studies applies more to the book field than the digital media field. <br/>
       I don't have any experiece with techniques such as HTML, CSS etc., but I do like to learn more about it. <br/> Related to the book field, I have been employed since the beginning of 2019 at a bookstore, where I get to learn a little bit about the purchasing and the selling of books. 
       Because I am not a permanent employee I don't go to book fairs to order books for the upcoming seasons, <br/>but I ask as much as possible how the process works at collegues that do go to these fairs. <br/> 
       With my academic background in history, I also worked with different kind of archives and libraries. Especially for my bachelor thesis and my internship at the NIOD I have worked with several different archives in the Netherlands.
      <br/> As a result of that I have seen several primairy sources and historical artefacts such as VOC inventories, journals and various documentations on the administration of justice regarding the aftermath of the Second World War in the Netherlands.</td>

As a humanities student I never thought I would learn about the codes that are used to make websites available for the human eye. Let alone, understand the coding that is behind most digital texts. However, I really like to expend my knowledge and computer skills.</td>
